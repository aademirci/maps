# About *maps*

maps is a project that follows one of Stephen Grider's TypeScript courses on Udemy.

It is a small app that shows random user and random company on map as a marker, and opens a pop-up in which the information for each is written.

The app uses Faker and Google Maps API.

## Installation notes

The repository needs to be installed and run by executing the command below:

```console

It might ask you to install Parcel for the first time you run this command, say yes (y).
